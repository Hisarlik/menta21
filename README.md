# Authorship Verification with neural networks via stylometric feature concatenation

This software was developed for the PAN 2021 author verification task. 

Our work focuses on extracting two stylometric features, character-level n-grams and the use of punctuation marks in the texts. Subsequently, we train a neural network with each of them and finally combine them into a final neural network for the classifier decision making. It is described in :
